The pri_Cd_data.csv stores raw data to derive the cadmium regression model for soil-crop and soil-solution relationships with the Rmarkdown file cadmium regression model.Rmd. The definitions of the parameters are:
X: longtitude
Y: latitude
land_use: land use type, as Paddy if the crop type is rice, otherwise Upland
pH: soil pH measured in water
SoilCdtot: Soil total Cd content in a 0-20cm soil layer
RiceCd: Cd content in rice grain
StrawCd: Cd content in rice straw
SoilCdavi: Cd concentration in soil solution in a 0-20cm soil layer
OC: soil organic carbon content
Clay: soil clay content in a 0-20cm soil layer
source: clay content in some sites were measured, otherwise the values were derived from SoilGrids â€” global gridded soil information
