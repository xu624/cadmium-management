The pri_Cd_data.csv stores raw data to derive the cadmium regression model for soil-crop and soil-solution relationships with the Rmarkdown file cadmium regression model.Rmd. 
The definitions of the parameters are:
* X: longtitude (WGS84, EPSG:4326)
* Y: latitude (WGS84,  EPSG:4326)
* land_use: land use type, as Paddy if the crop type is rice, otherwise Upland
* pH: soil pH measured in water
* SoilCdtot: Soil total Cd content in a 0-20cm soil layer
* RiceCd: Cd content in rice grain
* StrawCd: Cd content in rice straw
* SoilCdavi: Cd concentration in soil solution in a 0-20cm soil layer
* OC: soil organic carbon content
* Clay: soil clay content in a 0-20cm soil layer

source: clay content in some sites were measured, otherwise the values were derived from SoilGrids â€” global gridded soil information
